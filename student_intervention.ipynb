    "        1. Free-range eggs\n",
    "            - These are eggs from hens who are able to roam freely\n",
    "        2. Battery eggs\n",
    "            - These are eggs from hens who are kept in a small cage. Some may call this \"unethical eggs\"\n",
    "    - The study revealed that NB provided a high accuracy of 90% when classifying between the 2 groups of eggs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Strengths\n",
    "    1. Converges quicker than discriminative models like Logistic Regression hence less data is required\n",
    "- Weaknesses\n",
    "    1. Requires observations to be independent of one another\n",
    "        - But in practice, the classifier performs quite well even when the independence assumption is violated\n",
    "    2. Simple representation without opportunities for hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- Suitability for the problem\n",
    "    - This algorithm performs well for this problem because the data has the following properties:\n",
    "        - Low number of observations\n",
    "            - Naive bayes performs well on small datasets\n",
    "            \n",
    "**2. Logistic Regression**\n",
    "- Real world usage - Penderson et. al 2014\n",
    "    - Classification of protein sequences\n",
    "        - Identify and automatically categorize protein sequences into one of 11 pre-defined classes\n",
    "        - Tremendous potential for further bioinformatics applications using Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Strengths\n",
    "    1. Many ways to regularize the model to tolerate some errors and avoid over-fitting\n",

We also could note here that Naive Bayes performance gradually increases when more number of training data added to it and we also know that for large dataset Naive Bayes is the best suite. Because we know that how SVM's computational time would grow much faster than Naive Bayes with more data, and our costs would increase exponentially when we have more students. On the other hand, Naive Bayes computational time would grow linearly with more data, and our cost would not rise as fast. Hence, Naive Bayes offers a good alternative to SVMs taking into account its performance on a small dataset and on a potentially large and growing dataset.\n",

Although the results show Logistic Regression is slightly worst than Naive Bayes in terms of it predictive performance, slight tuning of Logistic Regression's model would easily yield much better predictive performance compare to Naive Bayes.

    "The model I have created is able to predict how likely a student is to graduate. It does so by analysing the 395 that already went through the program. By looking at the attributes of these students, it identifies cues that have been idicative for failing to graduate in the past. We can look for these cues in future students to get our intervention system. To get a feeling for how the model works, consider the picture below. Image you record two attributes for your students:\n",
    "\n",
    "- goout: how much they go out with friends (the higher the value, the more they tend to go out)\n",
    "- failures: how often they failed to pass a class before (the higher the value, the more often they failed before)\n",
    "\n",
    "You would probably expect both numbers to drive the chance of failing to graduate. You could then verify this expectation by drawing a picture like the one below. For each student, you would draw a blue dot if he failed to graduate and a red dot if he did not. You would draw dots more to the right the higher the failures attribute value is and the more to the top the higher the goout attribute value is. If your expectation is correct, you would see more blue dots (= studentes failed to graduate) in the upper right corner of your picture. Looking at the picture, you indeed see more blue dots than red ones there. You could now draw a line through the picture to seperate two areas, one in which mostly blue dots are and another in which more red than blue dots are. In the picture, you can see an example of such a line. You now have two areas, one in which students are likely to fail to graduate and the other in which they are likely to pass. Drawing a line is what the model I've created for you does when it learns from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see a new student now, then you can draw a new dot into the picture according to his failure and goout values and see where it the dot is. You would now check in which of the two areas the student is. Depending on that, you would either estimate he is likely to fail to graduate or not. The closer the dot is to the line, the less confident you will be about the prediction, i.e., you will assign higher probabilities to points far away from the line. To see why, check the dots in the picture. Close to the line, you have many blue and red dots on either side, so you cannot be sure. Deep inside the blue-shaded area though, most dots are blue. Similarly, deep inside the yellow-shaded area, most dots are red (exceptions exist of course). Checking on which side of the line a point is and how far it is away is what the model I've created for you does when it predicts the chance that a student fails to graduate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason you need the model and not just a picture is that the model does above described things mathematically and not in pictures, which is why it can look at more than just two attributes. If we were to look at, say, five attributes, we could not draw a picture anymore. The model however can perfectly work with the five attributes.\n",
